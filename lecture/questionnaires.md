# Questionnaires

Dialog between team members is a hallmark of any kind of collaborative work.
However, in the scientific process, a constant exchange of information between
lab members, co-authors, and, in the end, the scientific community, is of
paramount importance for the success of most (if not all) projects.
We believe this to be even more so in the context of scientific training, where
trainers and trainees can make use of feedback loops and
"goal-attainment-checks" to identify hindrances and the aids needed to overcome
them. 

Here, we provide a standardised method for the assessment of this type of
characteristics as students progress throughout the development of their
own projects.

We consider it to be crucial to assess already a the beginning
of a training session and/or lecture how much students know about the topic and
how confident the feel about applying these methods on the own, previous
to receiving any formal training. This provides a estimate of the students
baseline level, making it easier to evaluate their individual progress during
the project.

Thus, the questionnaire assessment it separated in to two sections, before and
after the training session. The specific topics and project steps are
interchangeable as indicated by the *<topic_of_interest>* placeholders.


## Before the training:

Please indicate how well prepared do you feel to take on the following part of
the project.

Use the following scale to answer: no, not at all (1) - yes, entirely (7)

**1.1)** At this stage, how well prepared do you feel to perform
*<topic_of_interest>*?

| **no, not at all** |     |     |     |     |     | **yes, entirely** |
|:------------------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|:-----------------:|
| (1)                | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7)               |

**1.2)** At this stage, how confident do you feel about *<topic_of_interest>*?

| **no, not at all** |     |     |     |     |     | **yes, entirely** |
|:------------------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|:-----------------:|
| (1)                | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7)               |  


## After the training:

Having heard about *<topic_of_interest>*, please indicate how well prepared do 
you feel to take on the following part of the project.

Use the following scale to answer: no, not at all (1) - yes, entirely (7)

**2.1)** How well prepared do you feel to perform *<topic_of_interest>*?

| **no, not at all** |     |     |     |     |     | **yes, entirely** |
|:------------------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|:-----------------:|
| (1)                | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7)               |

**2.2)** How confident do you feel about *<topic_of_interest>*?

| **no, not at all** |     |     |     |     |     | **yes, entirely** |
|:------------------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|:-----------------:|
| (1)                | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7)               |
    
Please take a moment to evaluate the following aspects of the
training session/lecture:

**3.1)** How well informed we're you with regard to the current topic? (i.e.,
did you know what was expecting you?)

| **no, not at all** |     |     |     |     |     | **yes, entirely** |
|:------------------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|:-----------------:|
| (1)                | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7)               |

**3.2)** Did the session/lecture provide enough opportunities for you to
actively participate?

| **no, not at all** |     |     |     |     |     | **yes, entirely** |
|:------------------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|:-----------------:|
| (1)                | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7)               |

**3.3)** How satisfied are you with the content of the training/lecture?

| **no, not at all** |     |     |     |     |     | **yes, entirely** |
|:------------------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|:-----------------:|
| (1)                | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7)               |

**3.4)** How satisfied are you with the didactic methods used during
the training/lecture?

| **no, not ar all** |     |     |     |     |     | **yes, entirely** |
|:------------------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|:-----------------:|
| (1)                | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7)               |

**3.5)** What was the most challenging part of the training/lecture?
Did something in particular helped you master these challenges? If you
didn't experience any difficulties, please tell us what the most 
helpful/insightful part of the training/lecture was for you (< 100 words):
