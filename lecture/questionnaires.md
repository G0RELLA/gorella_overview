# Questionnaires

Dialog between team members is a hallmark of any kind of collaborative work.
However, in the scientific process, a constant exchange of information between
lab members, co-authors, and, in the end, the scientific community, is of
paramount importance for the success of most (if not all) projects.
We believe this to be even more so in the context of scientific training, where
trainers and trainees can make use of feedback loops and
"goal-attainment-checks" to identify hindrances and resources needed to overcome
them. 

Here, we provide a standardized method for the assessment of this type of
characteristics as students progress throughout the development
of their own projects.

We consider it to be crucial to promote the dialog between trainers and trainees
already at the beginning of a lecture, as well as during specific training
sessions. By assessing how much students know about a topic and how
confident they feel about applying the methods in question on their own, 
prior to receiving any formal training, the teaching staff can estimate the 
baseline level of knowledge of the current students, making it easier to 
evaluate their individual progress during the project.

The assessment strategy thus consist of two parts:
1) A general evaluation of the students' knowledge and/or experience with
the topics of the lecture/training. This part can be applied at key points
throughout lectures/projects (e.g., at beginning, at midterm or before a
specific lecture's section).
Optionally, questions 1.2) and 1.3) can be presented a second time (e.g., at
the end of a section) to provide a comparison.

2) The second part of the assessment provides a more fine grained evaluation of
the students' degree of progress and difficulties during the sessions. The
questions 2.1) and 2.2) are designed to be answered by the students
prior to any specific training session and allow a closer look at the
their degree of "preparedness" and confidence in the topic.
Questions 2.3) to 2.9) target students' satisfaction with didactics and
content, but also experienced difficulties during the training.
The specific topics and project steps are interchangeable as indicated by 
the *<topic_of_interest>* placeholders in the templates below.

For an example of some of the assessment questions and question types 
"in action" see the following [Template](https://forms.gle/2sYLG2HLzAzFXKqF9).
For convenience and demonstration purposes, this is currently implemented in 
[Google forms](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6281888?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
However, we do encourage future users to choose other open source methods such
as [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/).
