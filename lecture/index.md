## Welcome

Hello everyone and welcome the overview and documenation page of GORELLA, we're excited you're here! Within these pages,
we would like to present and describe a framework for a "Generalizable Outline of Realistic Empirical research Lectures in Life Science and their Applications" or in short GORELLA. Not only is this a great abbreviation, but hopefully also reminds people that we need to do something now to save the Gorilla as a species (for more information please check [http://igcp.org/](http://igcp.org/) and [https://www.wwf.org.uk/get-involved/schools/calendar/world-gorilla-day](https://www.wwf.org.uk/get-involved/schools/calendar/world-gorilla-day)). The 1-2-3 of all this here is that we wanted to create a [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) resource targeting the empirical training of students in a standardized, fair, open and inclsuive manner. Furthermore, it is made in a way that supports interdisciplinarity and straightforward transfer, as well adaptation between different life sciences.  

## The situation




## The proposed solution



## The folks and their motivation

The "we", that's three people that were tired of the way the majority of empirical training of students is conducted. This entails [José C. García Alanis](), [Peer Herholz]() and [Christoph Vogelbacher](), all of whom coming from mixed background including psychology, neuroscience, data science and informatics. Over a time span of several years, we step-wise increased our efforts to improve the way empirical aspects are communicated and taught. From the supervision of students over lectures to workshops and large scale initiatives we tried our best to support and help students, making practical research more fair and accessible for everyone.
Through all these experiences and gathered feedback it become clear that something more is needed, something substantial. Thus, we compiled everything into a framework that is build upon the ideas and principles of open, reproducible and inclusive science, making the entirety of materials available and easily adaptable for everyone interested. The result is the very thing you are currently reading. We sincerely hope that, if we all work together on this further, we can create and introduce a paradigm shift in educating that mirrors the developments in science.

## Can I provide feedback or help out?

We would highly appreciate and value every feedback, idea or question you might have. Please don't hesitate a single second to get in touch with us. The same holds true for helping out and becoming an active part. In fact, if you want, you're herewith a part of GORELLA. No one achieves anything alone and we all need to get active to change things for the better. The key is open and fair collaboration via basis democratic decision making, where everyone (no matter you degree, status or background) is equal.
