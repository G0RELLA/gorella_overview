# Welcome  

Hello everyone and welcome the overview and documenation page of GORELLA, we're excited you're here! Within these pages,
we would like to present and describe a framework for a "Generalizable Outline for Realistic Empirical Life Science Lectures and their Applications" or in short GORELLA. Not only is this a great abbreviation, but hopefully also reminds people that we need to do something now to save the Gorilla as a species (for more information please check [http://igcp.org/](http://igcp.org/) and [https://www.wwf.org.uk/get-involved/schools/calendar/world-gorilla-day](https://www.wwf.org.uk/get-involved/schools/calendar/world-gorilla-day)). The 1-2-3 of all this here is that we wanted to create a [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) resource targeting the empirical training of students in a standardized, fair, open and inclusive manner. Furthermore, it is made in a way that supports interdisciplinarity and straightforward transfer, as well adaptation between different life sciences. We hope you'll find it useful and set up in comprehensive way. If you have any questions, problems or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us.




## What's all this now?

As you can see at the TOC on the left sidebar, there's quite a bunch going on here. We know, we know: "Oh my, is all of this really necessary?". Well, we think so and here's why: creating structural changes in the empirical training of students via a complex framework needs time, effort, details and dedication. To increase openess and substainability and thus ultimately the success, these things need to be prepared and supplied in a way that they are [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) for as many people as possible. Therefore, we want to provide as much information as possible, in a goaloriented manner. We gave our best to condense the last five years of our lives to something y'all can make use and sense of. The result is the already mentioned TOC, which includes the following sections:

* [GORELLA - an overview](https://gorella.netlify.app/overview.html)

   What's the problem and how are we propose to solve it?

* [General procedure](https://gorella.netlify.app/procedure.html)

   How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline](https://gorella.netlify.app/outline.html)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Introduction & theory building](https://gorella.netlify.app/introduction_theory_building.html)

   All things gotta start somewhere and scientific projects are no exception to that, but how?

* [Data analyses](https://gorella.netlify.app/data_analyses.html)

   How to obtain insights from data?

* [Results communication](https://gorella.netlify.app/results_communication.html)

   Where should the acquired knowledge to be disseminated?

* [Symposium](https://gorella.netlify.app/symposium.html)

   What to do about outreach and discourse creation?

* [Student projects](https://gorella.netlify.app/projects.html)

   Making sure the work and progress of the participants is transparent and documented.

* [Questionnaires](https://gorella.netlify.app/questionnaires.html)

   Was it worth it and how can this be evaluated?

* [The GORELLA base skeleton](https://gorella.netlify.app/base.html)

   Where are the materials?   

* [GORELLA tutorial](https://gorella.netlify.app/tutorial.html)

   Are there guidelines on how to start?

* [Code of Conduct](https://gorella.netlify.app/coc)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning experience.


## The folks and their motivation

The "we", that's three people that were tired of the way the majority of empirical training of students is conducted. This entails [José C. García Alanis](), [Peer Herholz]() and [Christoph Vogelbacher](), all of whom coming from mixed background including psychology, neuroscience, data science and informatics. Over a time span of several years, we step-wise increased our efforts to improve the way empirical aspects are communicated and taught. From the supervision of students over lectures to workshops and large scale initiatives we tried our best to support and help students, making practical research more fair and accessible for everyone.
Through all these experiences and gathered feedback it become clear that something more is needed, something substantial. Thus, we compiled everything into a framework that is build upon the ideas and principles of open, reproducible and inclusive science, making the entirety of materials available and easily adaptable for everyone interested. The result is the very thing you are currently reading. We sincerely hope that, if we all work together on this further, we can create and introduce a paradigm shift in educating that mirrors the developments in science.

## Can I provide feedback or help out?

We would highly appreciate and value every feedback, idea or question you might have. Please don't hesitate a single second to get in touch with us. The same holds true for helping out and becoming an active part. In fact, if you want, you're herewith a part of GORELLA. No one achieves anything alone and we all need to get active to change things for the better. The key is open and fair collaboration via basis democratic decision making, where everyone (no matter you degree, status or background) is equal.
