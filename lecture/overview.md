# GORELLA - an overview

There's a fair chance you're still wondering what all of this is exactly about.
Sorry, that's on us. On this page we want to provide a good amount of background
information, the problem and how we want to address it.

## The situation

In our scientific career (especially in the supervision of thesis work) we have
observed deficits in the empirical training (or at least in the
application of empirical research methods) among students. We believe that is
partly due to the rapid development of scientific methods.
On the other hand, our experience shows that the "old-way" of teaching
scientific methods allows one to pay only limited attention to topics
such as:
- the individual development of contemporary and practice-oriented scientific
"hard" (e.g. programming skills, application of tools) and "soft" skills
(e.g. project management, communication of results) 
- important aspects of standardization (e.g., use of robust data standards)
- the sustainable design of teaching and research materials

This leads to difficulties in everyday scientific life and in the application
of what is learned.

## The proposed solution

With _GORELLA_ we want to create a framework that can be used as a basis for
empirical teaching/training. The focus is not on the chalk and board technique, but on the
dynamic communication of content and realistic goal-setting.
For this purpose, different areas of Open Science (see [procedure](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/procedure.html))
are projected onto the life cycle of a project (see [outline](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/outline.html)).
