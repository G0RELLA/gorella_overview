# Welcome  

Hello everyone and welcome to the overview and documentation page for the
GORELLA project, we're glad to see you here! Within these pages, we would like
to present and describe a framework for a **"Generalizable Outline for Realistic
Empirical Life Science Lectures and their Applications"** or in short
**GORELLA**.

GORELLA is not only a great abbreviation, hopefully it also reminds people that
we need to do something now to save the Gorilla as a species (for more
information please check out
[The International Gorilla Conservation Programme](http://igcp.org/) and
[World Gorilla Day](https://www.wwf.org.uk/get-involved/schools/calendar/world-gorilla-day)
for more information on how to get involved).

The 1-2-3 of all this is that we wanted to create a
[FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) resource targeting the
empirical training of students in a standardized, fair, open, and inclusive
manner. Furthermore, GORELLA is designed to support interdisciplinarity and
straightforward transfer and adaptation between scientific fields 
in the life sciences. We hope you find GORELLA useful and it's set up
comprehensive. If you have any questions, problems or feedback, please don't
hesitate to get in touch with us.


## What's all this now?

As you can see at the TOC on the left sidebar, there's quite a bunch going
on here. We know, we know: "Oh my, is all of this really necessary?". Well, we
think so and here's why: creating structural changes in the empirical training
of students via a complex framework needs time, effort, details, and dedication.

To increase openness and sustainability, and thus ultimately the success rate of
projects, these things need to be prepared and supplied in a way that they are
[FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) for as many people as possible.
Therefore, we want to provide as much information as possible in a 
goal-oriented manner. We gave our best to condense the last five years of our
lives to something y'all can make use and sense of.
The result is the already mentioned TOC, which includes the following sections:

* [GORELLA - an overview](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/index.html)

   What's the problem and how are we propose to solve it?

* [General procedure](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/procedure.html)

   How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/outline.html)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Introduction & theory building](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/introduction_theory_building.html)

   All things gotta start somewhere and scientific projects are no exception to
   that, but how?

* [Data analyses](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/data_analyses.html)

   How to obtain insights from data?

* [Results communication](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/results_communication.html)

   Where should the acquired knowledge to be disseminated?

* [Symposium](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/symposium.html)

   What to do about outreach and discourse creation?

* [Student projects](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/projects.html)

   Making sure the work and progress of the participants is transparent and
   documented.

* [Questionnaires](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/questionnaires.html)

   Was it worth it and how can this be evaluated?

* [The GORELLA base skeleton](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/base.html)

   Where are the materials?   

* [GORELLA tutorial](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/tutorial.html)

   Are there guidelines on how to start?

* [Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.

## How to use this resource & its features

You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. 
The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying Github repository and allow you to download the walkthrough
as a `pdf` or `markdown file` respectively. Additionally, we support public reviews and comments through an [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) plugin 
with which you can interact on the right side. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/community), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and [mybinder project](https://mybinder.org/).

## The folks and their motivation

We are three people that were tired of the way the majority of empirical
training of students is conducted. This entails [José C. García Alanis](),
[Peer Herholz](https://peerherholz.github.io/), and [Christoph Vogelbacher](), all of whom coming from
mixed background including psychology, neuroscience, data science and
informatics. Over a time span of several years, we've step-wise increasing our
efforts to improve the way empirical methods are communicated and taught.
From the supervision of students over lectures to workshops and large scale
initiatives, we tried our best to support and help students and make practical
research more fair and accessible for everyone.

Through all these experiences and gathered feedback it become clear that
something more is needed, something fundamentally different, a paradigm shift.
Thus, we compiled everything into a framework that is build upon the ideas and
principles of open, reproducible and inclusive science, making the entirety of
materials available and easily adaptable for everyone interested.
The result is the very thing you are currently reading. We sincerely hope that,
if we all work together on this further, we can create and introduce a
paradigm shift in education that mirrors current developments in science.

## Can I provide feedback or help out?

We would highly appreciate and value every feedback, idea or question you
might have. Please don't hesitate a single second to get in touch with us.
The same holds true for helping out and becoming an active part. In fact,
if you want, you're herewith a part of GORELLA. No one achieves anything alone
and we all need to get active to change things for the better. The key
is open and fair collaboration via basis democratic decision making, where
everyone (no matter you degree, status or background) is equal. For further
information, please consult our
[Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/CoC.html).
