The following diagram shows the application of the GORELLA framework to the
life cycle of a scientific project. This includes the collection of ideas and
conceptualization, followed by execution and finalization of the project.

The GORELLA framework is thus sub-divided into modules that fit the
aforementioned project steps. Here, we provide a set of contents and outcomes
for each of the modules as a basis for teaching and practical implementation
of the framework.
