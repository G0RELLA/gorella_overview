The use of open science procedures is particularly important in order to ensure an
open & reproducible research workflow and create FAIR research outcomes.

In order to achieve this step, these aspects need to be applied to every step of
the research process. In turn this results in a tremendous amount of planning, as
well as tools and resources a researcher needs to know. To make this easier,
a group of fanatastic people created the [Rainbow of open science practices](https://zenodo.org/record/1147025#.X7KPJ5NKjUK).
It outlines important steps of a scientific research project and provides
corresponding pointers and tools to make them as open and FAIR as possible.

_GORELLA_ follows a similar approach and incorporates various aspects
of this amazing resource.
